# Remittance Calculator

This is a simple, single-page web application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that helps users calculate Euro to Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) remittances, taking into account the government's remittance bonus.

## Features

* **Calculate Received Taka:** Input a Euro amount, and the calculator determines how much Bangladeshi Taka the receiver will get, including the remittance bonus.
* **Calculate Euros to Send:** Input a desired Taka amount the receiver should get, and the calculator determines how many Euros need to be sent to achieve that amount, factoring in the bonus.
* **Configurable Parameters:** Users can input and adjust:
    * The Euro to Taka exchange rate.
    * The remittance bonus percentage.
* **Clear Results Display:** Results are shown directly on the page, not in pop-up windows.
* **Basic Input Validation:** Prevents common errors by checking for valid numeric inputs.

## How it Works

The application is built as a single `index.html` file (or whatever you name it, e.g., `remittance_calculator.html`). It comprises:

* **HTML:** Structures the user interface (input fields, buttons, result display areas).
* **CSS:** Styles the page for a clean and user-friendly appearance.
* **JavaScript:** Contains the core logic for performing the calculations and updating the UI based on user input.

The user interacts with the input fields and clicks one of the two calculation buttons. JavaScript functions read the input values, perform the necessary arithmetic based on the exchange rate and remittance percentage, and then display the results dynamically on the page.

## Calculations Explained

The core of this calculator lies in two main calculations, both factoring in the remittance bonus.

Let:
* `E` = Euro Amount
* `T` = Taka Amount (before bonus)
* `T_total` = Total Taka Amount (after bonus)
* `R` = Exchange Rate (BDT per EUR, e.g., 1 EUR = 117.5 BDT)
* `B` = Remittance Bonus Percentage (e.g., 2.5% = 0.025)

### Calculating Received Taka (Euros to BDT)

This calculation answers: "If I send `E` Euros, how much `T_total` Taka will the receiver get?"

1.  **Convert Euros to Taka (before bonus):**
    `T = E * R`

2.  **Calculate the Remittance Bonus:**
    `Bonus = T * (B / 100)` (where `B` is the percentage, e.g., 2.5)

3.  **Calculate Total Taka Received:**
    `T_total = T + Bonus`
    Which simplifies to: `T_total = (E * R) * (1 + (B / 100))`

**Example:**
If `E = 376 EUR`, `R = 117.5 BDT/EUR`, `B = 2.5%`
1.  `T = 376 * 117.5 = 44170 BDT`
2.  `Bonus = 44170 * (2.5 / 100) = 1104.25 BDT`
3.  `T_total = 44170 + 1104.25 = 45274.25 BDT`

### Calculating Euros to Send (Desired BDT to Euros)

This calculation answers: "To ensure the receiver gets a specific `T_total` Taka, how many `E` Euros do I need to send?"

1.  **Determine Taka needed before bonus:**
    Since `T_total = T * (1 + (B / 100))`,
    we can rearrange to find `T`:
    `T = T_total / (1 + (B / 100))`

2.  **Convert Taka (before bonus) to Euros:**
    Since `T = E * R`,
    we can rearrange to find `E`:
    `E = T / R`

    Substituting `T`:
    `E = (T_total / (1 + (B / 100))) / R`

**Example:**
If `T_total = 52000 BDT`, `R = 117.5 BDT/EUR`, `B = 2.5%`
1.  `T = 52000 / (1 + (2.5 / 100)) = 52000 / 1.025 = 50731.707 BDT` (approx)
2.  `E = 50731.707 / 117.5 = 431.76 EUR` (approx)

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Save the file:** Save the provided HTML code into a file named `index.html` (or `remittance_calculator.html`) in a folder on your computer.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Double-click the `index.html` file. It will open in your default web browser.
3.  **Input Values:**
    * Enter the current Euro to Taka exchange rate.
    * Adjust the remittance bonus percentage if it changes.
    * Use either the "Euro Amount to Send" or "Desired Taka Amount to Receive" input fields.
4.  **Calculate:** Click the corresponding "Calculate" button to see the results.

**Note:** For mobile usage, you can save this file using a dedicated code editor app on iOS (like Textastic or Kodex) or Android, and then open it within the app's preview or directly in a mobile browser.
